**KayTrust**, by NTT DATA, is a service to make Digital Identity, and particularly Self-Sovereign Identity, easier to use for every individual and organization.

KayTrust consists of a set of APIs (microservices) to work with digital identity. We also provide an SDK called KayDev, currently available for Javascript and Java.
